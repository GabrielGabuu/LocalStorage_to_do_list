This is a little personal project I undertook to enhance my DOM skills and to take my first shot at using an API

This is a simple To do list. 

You can: Add some tasks, markup when you finish it, edit the title content and remove as well.

I incorporated a filter and search function to make it more interactive.

For data storage, I used the Local Storage API, allowing task data to persist even when the page is refreshed or closed.
